# Star CloudPRNT for WooCommerce - from Star Labs

Star CloudPRNT for WooCommerce is a WordPress extension to enable automated order ticket/receipt printing each time a customer places an order on your WooCommerce based eCommerce website.

This can be used to quickly create a remote order/receipt printing solution for restaurants, take-aways, bakeries and similar sites, with minimal set-up time or cost.

This plugin can only be used alongside the WooCommerce WordPress plugin.  For more information on WooCommerce please visit www.woocommerce.com

## Star Labs

The *Star Cloudprnt for WooCommerce* plugin is a Star Labs project, this means that it is created and released, under an open source license, by Star Micronics employees or subsidiaries, but is not an official Star Micronics software product and not subject to the same guarantees, support or testing requirements from Star Micronics Co Ltd, Japan. As a result, quality, reliability and global support availability will vary between Star Labs projects, please check the project specific support information for details.

### Star Labs Project Status

This project has been developed primarily by the Star Micronics EMEA office in the UK, with assistance from Star Micronics America.

It is considered to be safe to use in production, with active support in the EMEA region, and community support offered elsewhere. However the wide variety of WordPress/WooCommerce site installations and configuration mean that compatibility with all sites, and all plugins can not be guaranteed, and testing is advised.

## Getting Support

### Developers

Developers who wish to modify/extend this plugin, or require support integrating their own plugins or themes should use the GitHub issue tracker.

Contributions and pull requests are welcome, but will only be merged in to the mainline release branches cautiously, due to a need for Star to maintain stability and be able to support existing customers.

If you intend to implement any large changes, then consider talking with the developers, and reviewing the project boards first to ensure that this does not conflict with any existing development plans, or you may wish to maintain a separate fork instead.

## Installation

For most live sites, the latest stable release should be installed via the WordPress plugin repository from the site admin page.
Users requiring a specific version, can also download the plugin as a zip package, which can also be installed via that admin page of their site.

Developers can checkout or copy the `star-cloudprnt-for-woocommerce` folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` folder of their site.

## Configuration

Each WordPress site that installs and enables this plugin will expose a Star CloudPRNT compatible endpoint that must be installed into a compatible device to connect it with your site.
Please refer to the [user documentation](readme.txt) for details, or [video walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O3pZJ-kfqk).
